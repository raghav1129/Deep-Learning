This project aims at building a CNN model to classify images of handwritten characters (0-9, a-z, A-z).
These two approaches are followed to build a efficient model:
1) Build the model from scratch and train it to classify images.
2) Using Transfer Learning use one of the pre-trained model (VGG16Net) to classify images.
The model achieves a accuracy rate of 76% using the VGGNet.
